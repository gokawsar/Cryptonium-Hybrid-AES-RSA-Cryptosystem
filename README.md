# Cryptonium-Hybrid-AES-RSA-Cryptosystem
This project implements a hybrid encryption scheme from scratch, combining the AES symmetric cipher for efficient bulk data encryption with the RSA asymmetric cipher for secure key exchange. The result is a functional web application that allows users to encrypt messages, securely share an encrypted AES key, and decrypt messages.
